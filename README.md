<h1 align="center">BoW2BERT : Sentiment Analysis</h1>

This project explores sentiment analysis using traditional Bag-of-Words(BoW) models
and modern Transformer-based models,BERT. 

The motivation behind this work is to examine the adaption of one of today's most influential standard models -- the Transformer, particulary BERT -- in comparison with classical feature-based NLP approaches such as Bag-of-Words.

By contrasting these methodologies, this project aims to provide a clear perspective on the evolution of sentiment analysis techniques, from conventional statistical representations to deep contextual language models.

### Baseline: Bag-of-Words Pipeline
#### Feature Extraction
- CountVectorizer (unigram+bigram)
- High-dimensional sparse token-frequency matrix
#### Feature Selection
- Chi-square statistical filtering
- Dimensionality reduction via discriminative feature ranking
#### Classifier
- Logistic Regression

### Advanced Model:  BERT-based Architecture
#### Backbone
- Pretrained BERT from Huggingface
- FT on sentiment dataset
#### Optimization & Efficiency
- Hugging Face Accelerate (multi-device & mixed precision training)
- JAX with JIT compilation for improved execution throughput
