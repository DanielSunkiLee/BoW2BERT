# BoW -> BERT : Sentiment Analysis

This project explores sentiment analysis using traditional BoW models
and modern Transformer-based models(BERT).

## Motivation

This project was created to understand the difference between traditional
feature-based NLP methods and modern representation learning approaches.

### (From) Bag-of-Words Pipeline
- CountVectorizer (unigram+bigram)
- Chi-square feature selection
- Logistic Regression

### (To) BERT-based Model
- Pretrained BERT from Huggingface
- FT on sentiment dataset
- Accelerate
- Speed-efficient with JAX/JIT

## Dataset from
